# Text Extraction from images

Users might sometimes need to read text present in a photo they clicked, or have saved in their gallery. Being visually impaired, it might not be easy for them to properly read the text. So we have provided a feature for users to click a photo, select existing photos, and extract all the text from them. This text is them spoken out to the user using our text-to-speech functionality.

## Workflow of the text extraction feature

- Open the Text Extraction screen and tap on it.
- Click/Select a photo.
- The photo, as well as the text extracted using OCR functionality is displayed in a dialog, with stop, replay, and pause options and is spoken out to the user as well.
