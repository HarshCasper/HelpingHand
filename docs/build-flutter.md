# Build instructions for the Flutter application

Once you have cloned the repository, you will find the Flutter application on the master branch.

To build it, you need to have Flutter installed. Refer to the official docs provided by Flutter over [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and install it for your operating system.

Once you're done, you can open up the application in your preferred editor. The best way to go would be to use Android Studio, but you can use any other editor such as VS Code as well.

The next step would be to enter the application directory and run the following command to fetch the dependencies.

```sh
flutter pub get
```

If you're using Android Studio, you can directly use the green play button to install the app on your device or an emulator. Else, you need to run the following command:

```sh
flutter run
```

This will run the application either on a physical device you'll have connected to your system or on an emulator that has been set up.
