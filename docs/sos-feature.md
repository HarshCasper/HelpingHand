# SOS

One of the most important features of the application is the SOS feature. In order to use the feature, a user just needs to enter 3 phone numbers on their phone.

To access the feature immediately without much hassle, a user just needs to vigorously shake the phone for 3-4 seconds and an SOS message with the exact location details of the user would be sent to the mobile numbers the user has entered.
